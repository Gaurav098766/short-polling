# short-polling

Request is taking a while, I’ll check with you later.
i)	Client sends a request.

ii)	Server responds immediately with a handle(identifier or token) to acknowledge the receipt of the request.

iii)	Server continues to process with the request

iv)	Server continues to process the request.

v)	Client uses that handle to check for status i.e it will pull like “is it ready ...”
